This document describes files and structured shared with Opkg. This is primarily
recherche of Opkg to ensure compatibility with it.

== Opkg on-disc structures

In case we decide not to use opkg as the backend (which is somewhat problematic
with the old updater and doesn't allow some nice features, like transactions), we
need to migrate from its data structures.

There are two possibilities. Either repeatedly call opkg to provide the
information (eg. `opkg list-installed`, `opkg files <package>`).  The other
possibility is to decode its on-disk data structures.

It would also be possible to use something backwards compatible with the opkg
structures (keep them up to date and use them, but add some more information to
other files, like journal).

Here's a list of files discovered to be used by opkg to store the database of
installed packages.

=== Global files

There's `/usr/lib/opkg/status`. This file lists all the installed packages. Each
one is represented by a block of email-like headers, listing some basic info about
the package. This is the local status of the package â€’ when it has been installed,
if it is installed as a dependency or requested by a user, etc. The block could be
different from router to router even for the same package, unlike the files in the
per-package files.

It is also important to note that single package can be noted there multiple times
with different version.

Expected fields are:

Package::
  Specified name of package.
Version::
  This is package version.
Depends::
  Comma separated list of dependencies. Every dependency is name of package.
  Optional version can also be specified. That is done in format `
Recommends::
  In general optional dependencies. This is not used in OpenWrt's packages (as of
  OpenWrt 19.07).
Suggests::
  In general optional extensions. This is not used in OpenWrt's packages (as of
  OpenWrt 19.07).
Provides::
  Comma separated list of packages aliases. Optional version can be specified the
  same way as in case of `Depends`.
Replaces::
  List of comma separated packages this package replaces. This is not used in
  OpenWrt's packages (as of OpenWrt 19.07).
Conflicts::
  Comma separated list of conflicting packages. Optional version can be specified
  the same way as in case of `Depends`.
Status::
  This is space separated triplet. Description is in following subsection.
Essential::
  The only acceptable value is `yes`. This marks package as essentially required.
  Removal of such package should not be allowed.
Architecture::
  This is package's architecture.
Conffiles::
  This is multiline (space indented) where every line is space separated pair of
  path and MD5 sum.
Installed-Time::
  Time of package installation. This is decimal number of time since epoch.
Auto-Installed::
  The only acceptable value is `yes`. This is used to label packages as installed
  only because they are dependency of some other package.
Alternatives::
  Space separated list of alternatives. Alternatives are essentially links.
  Multiple packages can specify same alternative target and the one with highest
  priority wins target. One alternative is triplet separated by `:`. First field
  is priority. Second field is link path. Third field is link target.

==== Status triplet

First field specifies wanted state:

unknown::
  Wanted state is effectively unknown.
install::
  Package should be installed. This is the only value commonly expected in
  `/usr/lib/opkg/status` file as there is commonly no reason to store in index
  any other state.
deinstall::
  Package should be deinstalled but not removed from system.
purge::
  Package should be removed from system.

Second field contains comma separated list of flags:

ok::
  This is default flag. This flag should be used if you do not want to use any
  other flag. It is ignored.
hold::
  This package should not be upgraded to newer version.
noprune::
  Old packages from this package should not be removed but rather appended to
  this package.
prefer::
  This version of package is preferred.
obsolete::
  This package is older than some other that replaces it.
user::
  This package is requested by user.

And the last third field contains status:

not-installed::
  The package is not in general installed. 
unpacked::
  Files of package are present in file-system.
half-configured::
  Package is half-configured. This seems to be unused by Opkg at the moment (as
  of 2020-08-31).
installed::
  State when package is installed and configured. This is the desired state.
half-installed::
  Package is in some way installed only partially. This seems to be unused by
  Opkg at the moment (as of 2020-08-31).
config-files::
  Package is not installed but config files are present and preserved in system.
  This seems to be set but accepted by Opkg at the moment (as of 2020-08-31).
post-inst-failed::
  Post-install of package failed. Such package is installed but can be
  potentially in broken state. This seems to be unused by Opkg at the moment (as
  of 2020-08-31).
removal-failed::
  Removal failed in any way. Package is not fully removed. Files can be present
  in system. This seems to be unused by Opkg at the moment (as of 2020-08-31).

=== Per-package files

There are some files for each installed package in the
`/usr/lib/opkg/info` directory. The files are named after the package
names, suffixed by the type of the file (eg. `package-name.type`). The
types are following:

control::
  This is the description block taken vanilla from the package. Some of the info
  is also found in the repository index list. It has email-like header format.
list::
  Lists the files owned by the package, one file per line.
conffiles::
  Lists the config files owned by the package (files that shall not be overwritten
  by an upgrade of the package). Note that config files are also listen in `list`
  file. The file is present only if the package has some config files.
preinst::
postinst::
prerm::
postrm::
  Executable scripts that are run in the right moment of installation process.
  They are present only if the package contains them.

There can be also other files. Those are used commonly by scripts. Opkg does not
use them but it manages them.

=== Package control files

`control` file contains additional fields that are not stored in
`/usr/lib/opkg/status` file. It is expected to be at least:

Section::
  Name of section package is included in.
Maintainer::
  Identified of maintainer of given package.
Source::
  Path to package in in OpenWrt's build tree (relative to `packages` directory).
SourceName::
  Name of source package. That is name used to build given package. This can be
  different to `Package` value.
License::
  License of packaged software.
LicenseFiles::
  Path to license files in source. These files are not in general present in
  resulting package so they are not accessible in running system.
Description::
  This can be multi-line user readable description of package.
Tags::
  This is list of package tags. This is not in OpenWrt's packages (as far as
  OpenWrt 19.07).
Require-User::
  This is OpenWrt's extension. It is used to create (ensure existence) of
  appropriate user. Format is space separated list of user-group pairs. Both user
  and group are specified in format `name=id` where `id` has to be number assigned
  to given user.
SourceDateEpoch::
  Time since epoch of source. Although supported in OpenWrt's build system it is
  not commonly used in packages.
CPE-ID::
  Common Platform Enumeration ID of software in package. This is commonly not
  present.
LinkSignature::
  This is Turris extension. This is used to identify link changes in package
  without version change. This covers situation when library changes API and all
  packages depending on it has to be reinstalled because of that.
FilesSignature::
  This is also Turris extension. This is used to identify changes in packages.
  This covers only list of files not their content and thus it won't trigger
  reinstall of package if file is changed. This covers situation when
  configuration changes and new file is added or moved between packages without
  package bump.

Compared to `/usr/lib/opkg/status` following fields are on the other hand not
present:

* Installed-Time
* Auto-Installed

Field `status` should not be present in general but in some cases it can be with
triplet: `unknown hold not-installed`.


== Opkg sequence

This section describes in which order Opkg does various steps that are part of
package installation/removal.

Opkg installs and removes packages one by one in their fullest. That is it runs
full sequence for one package before it moves to next one.

=== Installation

This sequence installs package but won't configure it.

1. Removes any package that is replaced by installed package
2. Runs `prerm` with `upgrade` argument if there is existing installed version in
   system
3. Runs `preinst`. Installation is aborted if this fails.
4. Backups modified configuration files as well as any file that wasn't marked as
   configuration file in old version but is now.
5. Checks for collisions between data files.
6. Runs `postrm` with `upgrade` argument if there is existing installed version in
   system.
7. Removes any obsolete files.
8. Removes control files from `/usr/lib/opkg/info` directory
9. Installs new control files to `/usr/lib/opkg/info` directory.
10. Merges data files to system and generates list of installed files.
11. Removes files ownership from any conflicting package.
12. Restores configuration files and renames new one to name with suffix `-opkg`
    if they differ.
13. Sets package state to `unpacked` for new version and as `not-installed` to
    old version if there was any. It also sets `Install-Time`.

=== Configuration

This sequence is executed as subsequent step to installation of packages.

1. Runs `postinst` with `configure` argument.
2. Updates alternative symbolic links.

=== Removal

This sequence removes package from system in the fullest.

1. Removes any dependent packages unless disabled.
2. Executes `prerm` script with `remove` argument. Removal is abandoned if that
   fails.
3. Removes files from file-system.
4. Runs `postrm` script with `remove` argument.
5. Removes control files from `/usr/lib/opkg/info` directory.
6. Sets package state to `not-installed`.
7. Updates alternative symbolic links.
8. Optionally removes orphan packages


== Opkg script execution environment

Opkg runs `{pre,post}{inst,rm}` script in defined environment and with defined
arguments. This gives scripts additional information to be used.

Scripts are executed always using `/bin/sh`.

Every script has these variables defined in environment:

PKG_ROOT::
  Path to root file-system.
PKG_UPGRADE::
  This has either `1` or `0` as a value and specifies if package is being upgraded
  or not (new installation or removal). This includes downgrade as well.

These scripts are not executed in offline (out of root) mode.


== Repository structure

This is format of packages index. This is file describing repository. It is
commonly expected to be named as `Packages`. It is possible to have it compressed
as well.

Packages index is list of packages available in repository in repository. It is in
mail-like format. Fields are same as in package's control file with addition of:

Filename::
  Package's file name. This is used to assemble URL to get package from
  repository.
Size::
  Size of package in bytes.
MD5sum::
  MD5 sum of package file. This is no longer provided by OpenWrt's build system
  but is still accepted and verified by Opkg.
SHA256sum::
  SHA256 sum of package file.
