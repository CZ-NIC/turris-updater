def current():
    """Returns currently existing aprroval request. If there is no approval
    request pending then it returns None.

    Existing approval is returned as a dictonary with following keys:
    "hash": This contains string identifying current request. This is used for
        updater's plan identification, most probably you won't need it.
    "status": This contains one following strings:
        "asked" if request was created and user have not decided yet.
        "granted" if request was approved.
        "denied" if request was denied and should be hidden.
    "time": This is time of request creation. It's number, a Unix time.
    "plan": This contains exact plan to be approved.
        "name": Name of package.
        "op": string identifying operation. One of following are allowed:
            "install" if package should be installed. Because of backward
                compatibility this also means upgrade or downgrade of package.
            "upgrade" if package should be upgraded (install newer version).
            "downgrade" if package should be downgraded (install older
                version).
            "remove" if package should be removed from system.
        "cur_ver: Currently installed version of package as a string. This can
            be None if it makes no sense for given operation (such as install).
            This can also be None when such information wasn't provided (should
            be expected because of compatibility reasons).
        "new_ver": Target version of packages as a string. This is None if it
            makes no sense for given operation (such as remove). This can also
            be None when such information wasn't provided.
    "reboot": This is boolean value informing if reboot will be done durring
            update. Note that this is forced immediate reboot.
