Dependency computation
======================

We use a SAT solver to compute which packages and in what versions
should be installed. We do so in phases and at the end we know the
result (or that the requirements are so broken we can't do anything
about them).

The SAT construction
--------------------

The formula describes dependencies between packages. This is derived
from the repository indices (and `Package` commands, if they are
present), but it doesn't yet consider what packages the user requests
to be installed.

We provide several kinds of variables:

* A variable for each package name that exists. Also this includes
  virtual packages and „provided“ packages (eg. if a package has a
  „Provides“ header).
* A variable for each package candidate that can be installed. These
  usually correspondent one to one with the package names. However, in
  case of multiple repositories, a package can have multiple
  candidates ‒ multiple versions or source repositories. We are
  interested in the final values of these variables.
* Request variables. In case the configuration specifies a certain
  version or versions of a package to install, we add a variable for
  such request (and add corresponding dependencies on the candidates).
  In case of installation request by a name only we use the package
  name variable directly. We do similar thing for
  version-dependencies.
* Auxiliary variables. As there may be complex dependencies, it is
  easier to use something like Tseytin transformation ‒ have a
  „result“ variable for each `Or`, `And` and `Not` operator.
* Penalty variables. When we choose from multiple options, we want to
  prefer some based on local criteria. These variables are added to
  these choices and are forced to false whenever a non-optimal choice
  needs to be done. By preferring these variables to be true, we
  prefer the better choices.

Further, we describe the relations. The SAT solver takes CNF, but we
describe the relations as other relations besides disjunctions here.
They are easy enough to convert and this way it is more readable.

Each package candidate implies corresponding package name (eg.
`!C∨N`). In the other direction, a package name requires at least one
candidate, therefore we get `!N∨C₁∨C₂…`. Furthermore, at most one
version of each package can be installed, so for each pair of
candidates of the same package we generate `!C₁∨!C₂`. This is not the
case for two packages „providing“ the same thing (they may block each
other, but that doesn't happen implicitly).

The request variables are handled in the same way as package names,
with the exception of their dependency candidates blocking each other.

Eventually we need to add the dependencies. As each package candidate
has its own dependencies, they are handled on the candidate variables.
Each dependency on a package without version is an implication to the
package name variable. Each dependency with version is handled with a
request variable.

The complex dependencies are handled by adding the corresponding
variables. The values are forced to correspond to the values of
subexpressions.

Every formula in dependency is only active when candidate it self is
selected. This way those formulas are not affecting computation process
unless the corresponding candidate is selected.

We add a penalty variable to each `Or` that is forced to false if
another but first option is selected (this is different than not
selecting the first one, as it may be possible to choose both).

We also penalize any candidates that are not latest. We add a penalty
variable for each not latest candidate. We also imply from the older
penalty variables to the newer ones, so we can express that version 1
is even less preferred than version 2 (which is worse than version 3).

We can consider package blocking as a `And(Not(*), Not(*), …)`.

[NOTE]
This SAT formula must be satisfiable, at least by not having
any package installed.

[NOTE]
As we don't know in advance what request variables we may need, we may
need to construct them as we go through the creation process and
possibly the further the phases. This is not a real problem, but it is
still easier to consider them pre-created in the description of the
following phases.

The critical packages
---------------------

We go through the `Install` requests and note any packages that are
marked as „critical“. We then fix these package name variables to
positive values (we can fix a variable value by inserting a singleton
clause). Then we check the satisfiability of the formula. If it is not
satisfiable, the base/critical system can't be installed and we refuse
to continue.

[NOTE]
This is a slight simplification, since the package criticality
can be restricted to certain versions. But for now, we don't care, if
any candidate of a package is considered critical and such package
name is requested to be installed, we consider it critical.

`Install` and `Uninstall` requests
----------------------------------

After partitioning the requests into groups with the same priority we
start with the highest priority. For each group we take the
corresponding package name and request variables and assume them to be
positive or negative (depending on if it is `Install` or `Uninstall`
request respectively). If the group contains an `Install` and
`Uninstall` request of the same variable, we refuse this input as
invalid.

With the variable values assumed we check satisfiability. If it is
satisfiable, everything is fine. If not, we ask for the largest
satisfiable subset of the assumptions. We then fix the satisfiable
assumptions.

After fixing the satisfiable variables, we move on to the next highest
priority group.

At the end of this phase we have determined all the requests we can
satisfy and fixed them. We also can produce warnings about which
requests we were unable to meet.

Package versions & alternatives
-------------------------------

We choose the `Or`-alternatives and candidates by using the penalty
variables. We first choose the `Or`-alternatives. We try to assume all
the `Or`-penalty variables are true, and fix them (or the maximal
satisfiable subset, if it can't be done). We do the same with the
candidates penalty variables.

[NOTE]
We currently computed which versions of packages will *not*
be installed. It still says nothing about which packages we need.

Package selection
-----------------

The last part is to choose which package candidates we actually want.
We take all the ones that were not fixed yet and assume them to be
false. This will result in unsatisfiable problem (at least in the case
the user requests at least one package). But by examining which
packages are not in the maximum satisfiable subset of assumptions we
know which candidates need to be installed.

Deterministic results
---------------------

In case not all results can be satisfied or when there are alternative
dependencies, there may be multiple possible solutions. We don't want
„flipping“, when the chosen result would be different each time and we
would modify the list of installed packages every run.

Therefore we make sure that the produced SAT problem is exactly the
same every time, including the order of variables, packages,
assumptions, etc. We do so by first sorting all inputs.

[NOTE]
There's a function to set seed in the SAT solver. If it turns out it
computes different things every time, we may need to set the seed to
constant value.

[NOTE]
We still might want to improve this further, so the solver prefers
already existing or close solution. But that is something to think
about later. We may do that by choosing all the maximal satisfiable
sets and picking the lexicographically smallest, or something like
that.
