Delayed morphers
================

It is possible to create Lua functions that may be called with or
without parentheses. However, this needs a small trick, especially
when the functions have multiple parameters or even variable number of
parameters.

When calling the function with parentheses, it happens as a single
call:

  Command("string", "string", {param = 1})

When calling without parameters (and also without commas), the call is
actually multiple calls, each with a single added parameters. So these
two things are equivalent:

  Command "string" "string" {param = 1}
  Command("string")("string")({param = 1})

Therefore, to make this work, every call must store the parameter
somewhere and then return something that can be called. That something
is a table with metatable. The table contains the parameters and
appends it there. The metatable specifies that it can be called.

After all the parameters are collected, the real function may be
called. For this to work, one active morpher must be kept in a global
variable.

 * When another function is started. The old one is first executed and
   the result is morphed into the real result.
 * When an end of script is reached.
 * When the morpher is used. We can use meta-tables to hook into the
   events, like stringyfying the result, or indexing it. It would
   first morph into the real result and then perform the operation on
   the morphed object.

The morphing is calling the real function and replacing the insides of
the morpher object with insides of the result. Also, the metatable
needs to be switched. This however works only on single table results.

The morpher functions can be generated from the real function,
therefore this machinery needs to be written just once.

The morphers should act similarly as if the functions were called
directly, except that some error conditions and side effects may
happen later on.

Some of these tricks may be demonstrated on the following code (until
the real code is written):


	#!/usr/bin/lua

	local m = {
		__call = function(table, text)
			print "Meta"
			return x(text)
		end,
		__tostring = function(table)
			print "Morph"
			return tostring(setmetatable(table, nil))
		end
	}

	function x(text)
		print "Called"
		print(text)
		return setmetatable({ t = text }, m)
	end

	local y = x"hello" "y" {} ()
	print(y)
	print(y)
