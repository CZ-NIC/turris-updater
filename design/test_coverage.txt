Test coverage
=============

Just writing tests without knowing what code is or isn't tested is like shooting
blindly. For this reason we have to generate and check test coverage informations
regularly.

Generating coverage information
-------------------------------

You can run all tests or any combination of tests to record coverage. But before
doing so you should clean whole project as coverage have to be explicitly enabled.
Also running valgrind tests is not recommended.

To run test with enabled coverage you should pass `COV=y` to make call. So running
all tests can be done by calling: `make COV=y test test-sys`

To generate website with coverage info you have to run `make COV=y coverage`.

To record coverage and generate website for all tests run:

  make clean
  make COV=y test test-sys
  make COV=y coverage
